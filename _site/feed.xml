&lt;p&gt;Knowing where I want to go, means I know exactly where I need to start.  I’ve got the hardware, but
it’s currently running EndeavourOS, and that’s not going to work for me.  I want to run it on
CentOS, and knowing I’ll be accessing it remotely, means I should be able to do a minimal install of
CentOS on the hardware and attach my external storage as part of the file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Goal here was to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install CentOS 7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Docker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the docker install&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Docker Compose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the basics to make sure Docker &amp;amp; Docker Compose were working as intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No plan survives contact with the &lt;s&gt;Enemy&lt;/s&gt; Computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-operating-system&quot;&gt;The Operating System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a whole stack of issues getting CentOS to work, everything from struggles with bad USB drives
(maybe?) to the machine sleeping whenever it felt like it.  I suspect most of those struggles were
my own doing, nonetheless…off with it’s head!!  As it were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did actually get CentOS kinda working, and I got docker installed, but I screwed up the install
process and ended up installing the entire OS on my external drive, which was a not-good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up using Fedora Server&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:F32&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:F32&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; instead of CentOS. The install process seemed to go more smoothly,
perhaps because I’d fixed some of the bugs in my process, but whatever the reason may be, I
currently have Fedora 32 installed on my laptop, which is hardwired&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:wifi&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:wifi&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to a dumb switch hanging off my
router.  Nifty.  DHCP reservation with a name gives me pseudo-DNS access to my laptop, including the
Fedora Server GUI which I really didn’t know was a “thing”.  The GUI is pretty nice, but mostly
useless for what I need, it works well and all, but I prefer the command line for most things, but I
do like the pretty pictures and graphs it gives me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I re-installed Fedora for the (I think 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;) last time I managed to setup the drives the correct
way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volume Groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ent_vgs.png&quot; alt=&quot;enterprise_vols&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Main OS Volume Group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ent_fedora_vg.png&quot; alt=&quot;fedora_vg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Volume Group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ent_data_vg.png&quot; alt=&quot;data_vg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note the pretty pictures from the Fedora Server GUI.  Ain’t they pretty?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got two VGs, one for the data, and another for the OS type files. In this case they are on
separate physical drives.  This should in theory allow me to expand if I need more storage by simply adding an additional drive(s), this should also allow the system to boot in the event something happens to the external drive, or it doesn’t mount right.  The internal drive will host most of the crucial functions this server will be handling, while the external will be used for data storage, i.e. my NextCloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also setup key-based authentication on my server to allow me to authenticate from my laptop to the
server without having to type in a password.  While you can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh-copy-id&lt;/code&gt; method, I
actually used the Fedora Server GUI for that, which worked like a champ, but I couldn’t find a way
to prevent password based SSH attempts in the GUI.  Removing that was easy enough (see the command
reference I used in the references section. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sshd&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sshd&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;docker&quot;&gt;Docker!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully Docker provides a very solid install guide for installing the docker-engine&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:dock-guide&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:dock-guide&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
unfortunately the base install process doesn’t quite work for Fedora 32.  With some very very clever
Google-fu, googling the error, led me to an open Bug report&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:bug&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:bug&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, with an additional step needed to complete the install, once that was done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hello-world&quot;&lt;/span&gt; image from the Docker Hub.
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;amd64&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker run &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu bash

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOOM!  Docker installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dns-is-a-pita&quot;&gt;DNS Is a PITA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/alwaysdns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;always_dns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some issues around DNS when installing Docker, which took a long, convoluted path to fix, and
I honestly don’t remember everything I did to get it working, I restarted Docker, and built (and
later removed) a docker daemon.conf file, but it did work, right up until I tried to get Docker
compose working.  I want to put the fix here because I think it should fix DNS issues within Docker
as well as Docker compose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version is that in Fedora/RedHat/CentOS recent versions the OS uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nftables&lt;/code&gt; by default, instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt;; this allows for better support of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and such. The issue is that docker doesn’t like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nftbles&lt;/code&gt;, so that’s fun.  It’s easily fixable by modifying a single line in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firewalld.conf&lt;/code&gt; file. Simply changing the line: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FirewalldBackend=nftables&lt;/code&gt; to:
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FirewalldBackend=iptables&lt;/code&gt; will fix the issue.  The Bug report and fix can be found
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/957&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Ideally that will be fixed in the future,
and it won’t be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;docker-compose&quot;&gt;Docker-Compose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker-compose is essentially a tool that simplifies the building of applications. While many
applications run on a single server and serve a single function using just a convoluted collection
bash script, python scripts, rust files, basic libraries etc. the vast majority of applications in
the world use a lot of assorted components: a web server, a database, a script that pulls data from
another source, etc. Compose is a simple way to bundle all of these things together to create
multiple containers that all talk to each other to create a full fledge application, which can be
started with just a single command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker-compose is written and provided by the team that maintains Docker, and the documentation can
be found in the same location ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/&quot;&gt;Docker-compose getting started&lt;/a&gt; ) The documentation is very very solid, and provides everything needed to get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the aforementioned DNS issue, I really had no issues getting compose up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-state&quot;&gt;Current state&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Installed &lt;s&gt;CentOS 7&lt;/s&gt; Fedora 32&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Installed Docker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tested the docker install&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Installed Docker Compose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tested the basics to make sure Docker &amp;amp; Docker Compose were working as intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All told this took me about 10-12 hours, mostly fighting with the CentOS install. I spread that out
over a couple of weekends, and some evenings, mixed in with the other things life demands I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install NextCloud&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how to actually effectively host NextCloud&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sort out the reverse proxy methods, and if I actually need one or not.  I expect that I will use
traefik for a reverse proxy just because it looks pretty straightforward to learn, and it’s wildly
popular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The tutorial I used can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://ostechnix.com/configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-linux/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but the short version is: Put the key file on the remote server, turn off password based authentication in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/code&gt; file, and restart ssh. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:sshd&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:bug&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned there are literally thousands of Linux distributions floating around the internet, so
how is someone new to the world of Linux supposed to know which one is right for them? It can seem
overwhelming at first glance, but lets take a look at a few things, like what makes up a “distro”
(That’s the cool way to say distribution), what different distros offer, and what really matters
when choosing a distro to install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-distro-exactly&quot;&gt;What is a distro, exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics, what, exactly, is a Linux distribution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system. Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).
&lt;br /&gt;A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most common being the X Window System), a window manager, and a desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a Linux distro is really just a collection of software, libraries, combined with a version(s) of
the Linux kernel.  All packaged together to make a working operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major differences between distros really boil down to the package manager, the default Desktop
Environment (we’ll get to what that is in a bit), and what software comes included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;package-managers&quot;&gt;Package Managers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package manager is just the tool used to install software that doesn’t come bundled with the
distribution.  There is great debate about which package manager is the “best”, and like all things
opinion, there is no one right answer. It really comes down to what
features/options/widgets/gadgets/geegaws are included, and what matters to the user.  All packages
managers do the same thing: they find software in a repository and install it on the computer, they
also update the software when new versions come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) so you don’t have to remember the exact commands to type
into a terminal, which is nice for those that like the pointy-clicky method for interacting with
their computers. Most modern Linux distros include a package manager with a GUI, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A word of advice to new users: Don’t let a GUI package manager option determine your decision, if
you’re going to use Linux, you might as well get over being afraid of the terminal, you &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;
need it at some point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desktop-environments&quot;&gt;Desktop Environments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the thing that makes a computer look a certain way, it’s how the desktop background is
applied, what the icons and colors are, and most include file managers, text editors, those nifty
bars that show you what applications are open and what time it is, and all the other stuff that
makes up the majority of user interactions with a computer.  At some point I’ll expound ad nauseam
about Desktop Environments. Not here though, I will provide a quick list and description of each of
them though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; Definitely different than Windows or OSX, lots of stuff included,
not lightweight at all&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xfce.org/&quot;&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt; Pretty lightweight, very customizable, very solid set of software
included&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(desktop_environment)&quot;&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; Very similar to Windows,
very solid, based on an older version of Gnome, but still updated and maintained regularly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mate-desktop.org/&quot;&gt;MATE&lt;/a&gt; also based on an older version of Gnome, again still very
popular and well maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; Another very popular DE with a good looking interface, and lots of very
nice themes, animations, and looks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several more, which I’ll cover in another post, but these are 5 of the more popular
options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something important to remember: You can install pretty much any Desktop Environment on any distro,
so even if a distro ships with a DE you don’t like, you can change it to one that you do like,
pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-recommendations&quot;&gt;My Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is likely to become pretty big over time, and I absolutely detest being forced to read
7,000 words to find the information I want.  So I’m going to put my generic recommendations right
here, kinda near the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ubuntu&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is pretty universally recommended for new Linux users, with good reason.  The company that
manages it (Canonical) is stable and has been around for a long time.  It’s not going anywhere, it’s
incredibly popular, and I don’t know that I’ve come across software for Linux that won’t run on it.
It uses the Gnome desktop environment by default, which is very good looking, yet doesn’t attempt to
emulate either the Windows or the OSX look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; release which means updates are packaged and made available in intervals, but
they are pretty well tested by the time they’re released.  So the software will be a little slow,
but things shouldn’t break when they get updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re new, and just want to see what this “Linux thing is all about”, use Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fedora&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getfedora.org/&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedora is another very solid choice for new users, especially people that are interested in working
in IT, or in supporting Linux in an enterprise environment.  Fedora is the bleeding edge of what
will become Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), which is very widely used by large companies,
especially in the U.S. (Ubuntu/Canonical seems to have more of the market share in other countries,
though RHEL is still widely used)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedora uses the DNF package manger which is very solid, and pretty much all Linux software is available in the RPM format used by the DNF package manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedora is also a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; release, but packages seem to be released faster than Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your new and think you want to work on Linux for a living, give Fedora a try, or if you’re new
and just want something simple that works, it’s a good option in that scenario as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;endeavouros&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://endeavouros.com/&quot;&gt;EndeavourOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EndeavourOS is a very different beastie than my other two generic recommendations. It’s a new
distro (at the time of this writing it’s been around for just over a year) but it is based on a
distro that’s been around for a long time, so even if the EndeavourOS team called it quits (unlikely
I believe) an installed instance of EdeavourOS could be used pretty easily.  EndeavourOS is based on
Arch, a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rolling&lt;/code&gt; release distro, which means packages are available essentially as soon as the
developers make them available to the public.  Arch is known for being difficult to install (I’ve
never tried it, but there are tutorials and guides to make it easier), EndeavourOS however has a
“click next” type installer which makes it very simple to install, and it works quite well in my
experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to play, and get a chance to really break things, or if you’re running very new hardware
this really might be the choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-not-install-kali&quot;&gt;Do Not Install Kali&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m new to Linux and I want to install Kali, how do I do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a question I’ve seen countless times.  The answer is that you don’t.  Kali is not a Linux
distro meant to be used daily, it’s not meant for new users, it’s just not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the team that maintains Kali:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are unfamiliar with Linux generally, if you do not have at least a basic level of competence in administering a system, if you are looking for a Linux distribution to use as a learning tool to get to know your way around Linux, or if you want a distro that you can use as a general purpose desktop installation, Kali Linux is probably not what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.  I know.  It looks cool on Mr. Robot.  You can make any version of Linux look like that.  Yes
it’s got &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;l33t h@x0r&lt;/code&gt; tools.  You can install those on just about any distro.  (You shouldn’t unless
you understand what they’re for and how they work though.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kali is a tool which has a very specific use case, if you meet that use case, I’m willing to bet
you’re not reading this website looking for basic Linux information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use Kali, you should have enough knowledge to figure out how to install it with out
asking for help on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know it comes up in reference to “security and Linux” a lot.  It’s not that kind of security.
It’s a tool to see how secure a network is.  If you’re looking to hide your activity on the
internet, you want &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qubes-os.org/&quot;&gt;QubesOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distro-options&quot;&gt;Distro Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want some more information, or want to know more about different distros, I’m going to try to
keep this section updated, with the distros I come across that I see frequently.  This is not a
comprehensive list by any means, just some info on the distros I see referenced frequently with some
information about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stable-vs-rolling&quot;&gt;Stable vs Rolling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two major types of release/update cycles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stable:  Stable doesn’t mean “won’t break” it just means releases for the distro (not
applications) are packaged together and sent out in one big chunk, so you get things like: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ubuntu
20.04 Focal Fossa&lt;/code&gt; which will have all of the core things that make up the Distro in one single
update package, where the system is upgraded from the old version to the new version.  These
updates are generally tested together and in theory everything should play nicely. Like all things
computery, that may not always hold true.  The applications not considered part of the core distro
will still be updated when the app developers make their updates available, so updates will still
happen outside of the major release for the distro.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rolling:  Rolling release cycles are just that, constant (by comparison to stable) updates, when a
part of the kernel is updated, the package is made available and users can update just that
little piece.  This does mean that there is a potential for things to not work quite right with a
specific system configuration, but these things are generally quickly identified and documented.
Personally I’ve never had a problem with a rolling release, but I’m just one person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-my-list-is-formatted&quot;&gt;How My List is formatted&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many distros are based on a different distro, or upstream distro, which can also be installed, so as
I go through this list I’ll use different level headings to show if a distro is forked from another
major distro or not.  It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;top-level-distro&quot;&gt;Top Level Distro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fork-of-the-top-level-distro&quot;&gt;Fork of the top level Distro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;fork-of-the-fork&quot;&gt;Fork of the Fork&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Heading will be a Link to the distro home page which will have more information than I’m going
to include, and more up to date information.  While I could copy and paste that information here,
that seems silly, and frankly I don’t want to.  What I will do is make it easy for you to go find
information, and make your own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;debian&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/intro/about&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian is one of the longer running distros, and is what Ubuntu is forked from.  Very solid, though
it’s not as user friendly as Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the Debian forks listed below are stable releases using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; package manager, and all
have access to the same repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ubuntu-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most widely used distros ever (for desktop users), run by Canonical it’s a very
very popular distro.  It’s so widely used that most of the time when I find instructions for how to
do something in Linux the instructions default to Ubuntu.  Most software is packaged for Ubuntu,
    which makes using it day to day quite simple.  The default desktop environment is Gnome though
    there are specific images for for other DEs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;mint&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxmint.com/&quot;&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mint came about as an Ubuntu fork, and has grown to have it’s own dedicated following, the Mint team
is responsible for the Cinnamon desktop environment.  Mint is a truly great distribution for helping
someone transition to Linux from windows, as many of the Windows behaviours (bottom left “start
menu”, right click on the desktop, etc.) are replicated in Cinnamon.  It also uses the same package
manager, and repositories for Ubuntu, which means there’s a huge quantity of software easily
available, as well as many guides for how to do things, or solve problems on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;xubuntu&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xubuntu.org/&quot;&gt;Xubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Ubuntu with the XFCE Desktop Environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;lubutnu&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lubuntu.net/&quot;&gt;Lubutnu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Ubuntu with the LXDE/LXQT Desktop Environment, which makes the distro very lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;kubuntu&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kubuntu.org/&quot;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Ubuntu with the KDE Desktop Environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-red-hat-family&quot;&gt;The Red Hat Family&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m grouping 3 distros together here, although they’re not exactly forked from each other, they are
all related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;red-hat-enterprise-linux-rhel&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en&quot;&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat is one of the giants in the Linux world.  In the U.S. I would guess there are more RHEL
servers installed than any other, by a wide margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RHEL is available and can be installed as a workstation, but it’s not Free, it’s $99 for a license at the time of this writing, you can buy it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/store/linux-platforms&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if that something that interests you.  Personally I wouldn’t. RHEL is really meant to be a server operating system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fedora-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getfedora.org/en/&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora is really solid stable release distro (It’s what I’m currently using) Gnome is the default
desktop environment that ships with it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://spins.fedoraproject.org/&quot;&gt;Fedora Spins&lt;/a&gt; offer several other options for desktop environments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedora is the upstream source for a lot of the packages that go into RHEL, but it is technically a
different project and RHEL isn’t really forked from it.  If it were a Facebook status relationship
it would be “It’s Complicated.” Fedora is really the best option for those that are interested in
understanding and working with RHEL, and want to try it as a workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;centos&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centos.org/&quot;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS is essentially the free version of RHEL. It’s primary use case is as an appliance or server,
it’s not really geared towards being a workstation. The source code is provided by Red Hat, and my
understanding is that CentOS is used as a test bed for some RHEL features.  If you want to host your
own server of some sort, this is an excellent choice, since many of the things you might want to do
have been done by large companies, the odds that you’ll be able to find an answer for any problems
you encounter are very high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-suse&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensuse.org/&quot;&gt;Open Suse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suse Linux is one of the older Linux distributions around, it’s been used in the corporate world for
a long time, and there are still services that use it almost exclusively.  OpenSuse is the free
version of Suse.  (Big shocker there, I know) Suse uses a different package manager than the
Fedora/Red Hat/CentOS ecosystem, but that package manager does use RPM files, which means just about
anything that will run on the RHEL type distros will work with Suse.  It’s a bit of a niche distro,
but it does have something very few (if any) other do, both a rolling and a stable release version.
Which makes it very useful for people that are developing for or supporting Suse servers.  It’s
fairly newbie friendly, and has strong community support, if not a huge community of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-use-arch-btw&quot;&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt; btw&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch Linux and “I use Arch btw” have become a bit of a meme on the internet.  There was a point in
time when Arch users were known to tell people at every opportunity that they used Arch, it was
viewed by some as a badge of honor.  That is because Arch is not something that is easy to install,
or manage. If installing Linux is riding a bicycle installing Arch is like getting a box of parts
that have to be assembled. In other words you have to read carefully and follow directions, and understand what your machine is doing to successfully install Arch.  If you want to learn about how your operating system works, Arch is a great choice, it’s a rolling release distro which ensures the very latest packages are available, and it provides really granular control of your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arch has brought one of the single best resources to the Linux community in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_page&quot;&gt;ArchWiki&lt;/a&gt; This is a truly fantastic resource for anyone using Linux.  Go ahead and bookmark it.  While the instructions are all geared towards Arch users, the information typically applies across the board, even if the specific instructions don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;endeavouros-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://endeavouros.com/&quot;&gt;EndeavourOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch with training wheels, well mostly just Arch with a GUI “click next” installer, you still get
all of the benefits (and challenges) of a rolling release with a simple install method. The
installer provided by the EOS team allows for granular control of the packages, or a simple
“recommended” install option.  The installer works well, and will have you up and running pretty
quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manjaro&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://manjaro.org/&quot;&gt;Manjaro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If EndeavourOS is arch with training wheels, Manjaro is a tricycle.  While Manjaro is still
technically a rolling release the team behind Manajaro often holds packages back for a week or so to
hopefully catch any major failures before they’re released to the Manjaro community.  As a result
the distro is fairly stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gentoo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gentoo.org/&quot;&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stretch an analogy to the point of breaking, if Arch is a bicycle you have to assemble, Gentoo is
a pile of metal that has to be formed in to parts to be assembled into a bicycle.  It is designed to
be &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what you need and nothing more, nothing less.  Being this granular requires some
additional work on your part.  Again, once you get it working, you will know in great detail how
your machine works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;linux-from-scratch-lfs&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/&quot;&gt;Linux from Scratch (LFS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LFS is not a pile of metal to build a bicycle, LFS is a list of locations of ore, instructions on
how to mine the ore, create the parts, and assemble the bicycle.  LFS is really more of a training
tool than an actual distro meant to be used.  LFS is a fantastic way to learn about how Linux works
at a very low level.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">So Many choices, so few computers</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Planning my Own Cloud</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/self-hosting/2020/10/10/hosting-beginning.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Planning my Own Cloud" /><published>2020-10-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/self-hosting/2020/10/10/hosting-beginning</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/self-hosting/2020/10/10/hosting-beginning.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-goal&quot;&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used cloud services pretty steadily for the last 10 years or so.  My documents, résumés,
pictures, everything really, all lives in the cloud.  As companies and governments get more and more
blatant about their disregard for our privacy in favor of their profits, I’ve moved from cloud
service, to cloud service.  I’ve used everything from Google to iCloud, to Microsoft’s OneDrive, and
ended up settling on NextCloud hosted in a GPDR compliant country.  Which is good, really good
actually.  Except for one issue, it’s &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;, like dial-up slow.  As a place to archive it’s fine,
but for anything I want to use on a semi-speedy basis, it’s essentially unusable. (Think finding a
picture from a year ago to paste in a group chat)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to have an option that is relatively speedy, but still as secure as I can get it, I’ve come to
the conclusion that I need to self-host my own NextCloud instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which sounds easy, and can be, assuming you only want to access your data on your home network.
Which is a perfectly viable option for many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to be complex, and do things the hard way.  So here’s the End State goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Privately hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.com/&quot;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt; instance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Privately hosted Website (very very future state)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internal DNS via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;PiHole&lt;/a&gt; for ad blocking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reverse Proxy for traffic routing via &lt;a href=&quot;https://traefik.io/&quot;&gt;Traefik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think at this point everything will be running on an old laptop I’ve got laying around.  It’s got
8G of RAM (upgradable) and a Core i5 so for my use case I think it should be able to handle
everything, at least to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be running Docker, and I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; Docker Compose to manage the containers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-tools&quot;&gt;The Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from the base up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The home network is Gig fiber to a Ubiquiti Amplifi mesh router&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Laptop in question is a Dell Latitude E6440 with a Core i5 and (currently) 8 gigs of Ram, with a
relatively small SSD (120G), most of the storage will be hosted on an external 2TB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;software&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Base Operating System: CentOS
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As I’ve mentioned, in my day job I do some Linux Admin type stuff, and I’ve got a fair amount
of experience with CentOS in a server role.  It does that very well.  It works, and I’m
comfortable in the RHEL/Fedora/CentOS space.  I figure I might as well stick with something
I’m comfortable with.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Docker/Docker Compose for container management
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I’ll be using Docker compose for simplicity of managing the containers, for upgrades, repairs
etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nextcloud for most cloud functions
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;NextCloud offers an incredibly simple UI for others to use, as well as compatibility with
pretty much every OS out there.  In a house with: Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, iOS, iPadOS;
interoperability and ease of use is a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; thing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PiHole for DNS/Ad Blocking
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;PiHole is great for dropping ad traffic in a blackhole never to report telemetry again.  This
may end up running on a spare RasperryPi that I have laying around, but my intention at this
time is to put it on the main server.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-path&quot;&gt;The Path&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things start to get a bit muddy.  This is kind of what I’m thinking right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work through some basic docker tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work through some basic docker compose tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add Traefik to the main server, and work with pointing it at different containers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install a NextCloud docker container&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install a PiHole container&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Profit???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is of course subject to whims of fate and time. So who knows what this path will look
like in the end.  I’d like to think that I’m going to continue to update this as I go through the
process, so we’ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Goal</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why Use Linux?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/beginners/2020/10/04/why-linux.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Use Linux?" /><published>2020-10-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/beginners/2020/10/04/why-linux</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/beginners/2020/10/04/why-linux.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-linux&quot;&gt;Why Linux?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question in the process of switching from Windows or MacOS is pretty much always “Why   &lt;br /&gt;
should I use Linux?” Which is a valid question, and an important one.  The answer to that question&lt;br /&gt;
can shape a person’s path through the world of Linux. While people go to Linux communities and ask
that question on daily basis, it’s ultimately  a question each person has to answer for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few major reason for someone to switch to Linux&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-why-not-crowd&quot;&gt;The why not crowd&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, this group already knows why they want to use Linux, this is the hobbyists. They’re
going to spend hours finding the perfect distribution, tweaking it just right, and then blowing the
whole thing away and trying something new.  It’s fun, it’s cheap entertainment, and they just want
to play around with all the options out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-career-crowd&quot;&gt;The career crowd&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the group that wants to work in the IT field in some capacity and they want to use Linux on
their personal machines so they’re fully familiar with it when they go to work in an enterprise and
are confronted with 35,000 Linux servers they are now responsible for managing, or they’re software
developers and want to develop on Linux for any number of reasons from ease of workflow, to
available tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-privacy-crowd&quot;&gt;The privacy crowd&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the biggest influx of new users in the last few years.  Windows 10 collects a
&lt;strong&gt;ton&lt;/strong&gt; of data on the users.  This is concerning to many people, and rightfully so.  So they’ve
asked how to prevent this data collection, and one of the answers is inevitably “Switch to Linux!”
With the source code being available and audited by anyone and everyone, it’s difficult to sneak in
dirty rotten data collection tools to a Linux distribution, though not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since many of the Linux distributions are built, distributed, and maintained by small groups of individuals, or
non-profit organizations, there’s very little reason to collect user data.  The few major distributions maintained, managed, or owned by for profit companies (Primarily Canonical-Ubunutu, Suse-Suse &amp;amp; OpenSuse, RedHat-RedHat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS) are still heavily contributed to by the community, and have open source code.  Those companies make their money from support contracts sold to businesses, not from selling user data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many reasons individuals chose to use Linux those are the three biggest reasons I
see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll address &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; Linux Distribution to use in another post. (Spoiler: It’s &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; Kali, it’s
&lt;strong&gt;NEVER&lt;/strong&gt; going to be Kali)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Why Linux?

&lt;p&gt;Linux is just an Operating system.  In the grand scheme of things it’s not much
different from Windows, MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, Android, BSD or any other operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the collection of files that make up all the little bits and pieces of things that makes your computer a
computer, and not a very expensive brick.  For the every day user it defines how the user interacts with
their computer, what software can be installed, how their pictures are displayed, and all of the
other things that someone might do on their computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of major differences between Linux and the other Operating systems someone might
encounter in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foss--free-as-in-freedom-not-beer-open-source-software&quot;&gt;FOSS- Free (as in Freedom, not beer) Open Source Software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code for the Linux kernel is “Open Source”, which really  just means you can go to GitHub
and see all of the code that makes up the Linux kernel &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; You
can take that code, modify it, change it, do anything you want to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be said for many if not most of the Linux distributions floating around the internet.
The source code can be modified and changed and given away as much as a person desires. There are
some limitations based on licenses, but that’s a conversation for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a huge difference from Windows and MacOS in that those companies make money by selling their
operating systems, so they keep their code “proprietary” and don’t openly share their code.  You
can’t take the source code for windows and modify it, or change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note about the word &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt; as used in this context.  ‘Free’ here means ability, it does not
mean without cost.  While most variations of Linux are available for no cost, there are variations
that charge for assorted features, addons, service etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distributions&quot;&gt;Distributions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the source code for the Linux kernel is open, and people are allowed and even encouraged take
it and change it and add things to it, people do all of those things.  So when someone is going to
switch to Linux, one of the first decisions to make is which distribution to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are literally thousands of distributions floating around the internet, all of which do
slightly different things, from different color schemes, to different updating methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://distrowatch.com/&quot;&gt;Distrowatch&lt;/a&gt; to see a small sample of the available
options out there.  (I’ll cover choosing a distribution in another post)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">What is “Linux”?</summary></entry></feed>
