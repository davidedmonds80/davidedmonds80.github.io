## A little about the intent and purpose of this website: 

First a disclaimer:

**I am not a professional.  While I do a bit of Linux admin in my day job, in the enterprise arena I'm far from anything anyone would call an expert.**

I am a hobbyist, in the true sense of the word.  I play with Linux for fun, I break it and rebuild
it, and install terminal file managers and tweak nvim config files because I am that kind of person.
My family has learned to accept me for who I am, and they quietly put me in the garage where my
clicky keyboard won't annoy too many people.  My opinions you'll suffer through here are just that,
opinions of a hobbyist, they're informed by my life experiences, and should be taken with a grain of
salt like all opinions.  If you disagree, that's totally fine, feel free to email me and tell me I'm
wrong and that I smell funny.  If I'm actually wrong about something...please do email me and let me
know. 

The goal here is to provide information for (mostly) new Linux users, at least to point them in the
right direction, to answer the very common questions it seems all new users have, maybe to provide
some basic documentation on how a thing works for me, or how I got something to work.
